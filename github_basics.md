# 🚀 GitHub Basics & Essential Commands

New to GitHub? Here’s a quick primer to get you up and running with the basics of version control and GitHub command line usage!

## 📌 What is GitHub?

GitHub is a platform for hosting and collaborating on code using Git, a distributed version control system. It helps developers track changes, manage branches, and collaborate with others on software projects.

## 🔧 Key Git Commands

- `git init` – Initialize a new Git repository.
- `git clone <url>` – Clone an existing repository.
- `git status` – Show the working tree status.
- `git add <file>` – Add file contents to the staging area.
- `git commit -m "message"` – Commit changes with a message.
- `git push` – Push changes to the remote repository.
- `git pull` – Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository.
- `git branch` – List, create, or delete branches.
- `git checkout <branch>` – Switch to another branch.
- `git merge <branch>` – Merge changes from another branch.

## 📁 Basic Workflow

1. Initialize repo: `git init`
2. Add files: `git add .`
3. Commit changes: `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
4. Connect to GitHub: `git remote add origin <URL>`
5. Push code: `git push -u origin main`

## 🎯 Tips for Beginners

- Always write clear commit messages.
- Pull frequently to avoid merge conflicts.
- Use branches for new features or experiments.
- Don't be afraid to explore! Mistakes are part of learning Git.

💡 Mastering Git and GitHub opens the door to seamless collaboration and better project management. Keep practicing!

— Happy Coding 🚀

## 🚧 Common Challenges and How to Overcome Them

**🔹 Data Overload**  
Too much data can lead to analysis paralysis. Focus on the metrics that truly move the needle.

**🔹 Poor Data Quality**  
Unreliable data leads to poor decisions. Establish clear data standards and routine quality checks.

**🔹 Siloed Systems**  
Fragmented data creates blind spots. Invest in integrated platforms and cross-team accessibility.

**🔹 Low Data Literacy**  
Not everyone speaks data. Offer basic training and easy-to-use tools to build confidence.

**🔹 Change Resistance**  
Shifting from gut feeling to data-driven thinking takes time. Start small, share wins, and build trust.
